# LIMITLESS
LIMITLESS is a streamlined OSR TTRPG system with a 2d20, roll-under mechanic that's beginner-friendly yet deep enough for veteran players. Use this system in your next game by including the text "A LIMITLESS roleplaying game" somewhere in your doc. Cheers!

## Principles
LIMITLESS was written with these principles in mind:

### No Classes
Your Character's abilities are determined by their Stats and Equipment.

### No Skills
Simply describe what your Character does and the GM will determine the Check.

### No Spells
Simply describe what your want to happen and the GM will determine the Check.

### No Levels
Your Stats have a chance to increase as you play, making levels uneccessary.

### No Waiting
Initiative is determined by Combat Checks each round making the battlefield fun & fast paced.

### No Math
Checks resolve when dice roll over & under target numbers, making Modifiers unecessary.

### Deadly Combat
Every weapon has the potential to do lethal damage. When you are on the battlefield you are literally fighting for your life!

### Active Defense
Players roll to defend, keeping you engaged even when its not your turn.

### Open Source
LIMITLESS is proudly released under the [Open RPG Creative license (“ORC License”)](https://paizo.com/orclicense) for others to use.

## Why I Wrote This
I’ve been playing tabletop games for years, and one thing that’s always bugged me is the all-or-nothing feel of the d20 and the inexplicable natural 1s and 20s. I mean, would Legolas ever completely botch a bow shot like someone who’s never held one in their life? And why should an unexperienced character have a 5% chance of an amazing success? In my view, high level characters should succeed more and fail less. After exploring other systems, I found dice pools to be a better solution.

Classes were another thing. People claim to like them, but there are probably hundreds of books trying to come up with the perfect class that matches the character's players have in their heads. I decided to get rid of the idea of classes, skills and spells altogether and instead expand the number of stats in the game to give player's and their GMs ultimate flexibility. I'll put it this way: Gandalf used a sword. I rest my case.

Modifiers and rules aren't fun. You roll the die, add your stat modifier, weapon bonus, feat bonus, and on and on. At the end of the day, I just need to know what I'm supposed to roll. Games like [The Black Hack](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/255088/the-black-hack-second-edition) simplify things with a roll-under mechanic, which I found really appealing. But I wondered: how could you tweak difficulty without piling on modifiers and defeating the simplicity of the roll under mechanic? That’s why I came up with [Difficulty](/getting-started/core-mechanic), where you roll under your stat and above the Difficulty. Simple, with no math needed!

Then there was hit points — they never felt right.Taking 5 damage means nothing when you have 50 HP.A knife-wielding stranger in an alley should be terrifying, even to a trained soldier, but 1d4 damage in most games is pathetic! Abstract Wound systems kind of worked, but get pretty complicated.  That’s why I created [Deadly Weapons](https://jacobrex.itch.io/deadly-weapons), where all weapons use 1 to 6 d10s for damage and take the highest roll. That way ever weapon has the potential to deal a lot of damage, making every fight feel like a real battle.

Playing through a 3-hour combat never felt worth it, especially when most of my time was spent waiting! With LIMITLESS's Combat mechanic, you can determine who hits, who misses, and initiative in one roll, eliminating have of the Combat checks! Plus, it adds an element of surprise by randomizing initiative each round!

Finally, there was Armor Class. Why is it only provided by armor and shields? In reality, swords and the like allow you to defend and attack, and I wanted a system that would account for that's why I created [Deadly Weapons'](https://jacobrex.itch.io/deadly-weapons) active defense system, where you roll to defend against and reduce incoming damage based on your equipment. A barbarian with a sword is no longer defenseless!

I hope you enjoy LIMITLESS as much as I do. Now go forth and make great games!
