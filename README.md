# LIMITLESS
Limitless is a streamlined OSR TTRPG system with a 2d20, roll-under mechanic that's beginner-friendly yet deep enough for veteran players. Use this system in your next game by including the text "A Limitless roleplaying game" somewhere in your doc. Cheers!

## Principles
Limitless was written with these principles in mind:

### No Classes
Your Character's abilities are determined by their Stats and Equipment.

### No Skills
Simply describe what your Character does and the GM will determine the Check.

### No Spells
Simply describe what your want to happen and the GM will determine the Check.

### No Levels
Your Stats have a chance to increase as you play, making levels uneccessary.

### No Waiting
Initiative is determined by Combat Checks each round making the battlefield fun & fast paced.

### No Math
Checks resolve when dice roll over & under target numbers, making Modifiers unecessary.

### Deadly Combat
Every weapon has the potential to do lethal damage. When you are on the battlefield you are literally fighting for your life!

### Active Defense
Players roll to defend, keeping you engaged even when its not your turn.

### Open Source
Limitless is proudly released under the [Open RPG Creative license (“ORC License”)](https://paizo.com/orclicense) for others to use.

## Why I Wrote This
I’ve been playing tabletop games for years, and one thing that’s always bugged me is the all-or-nothing feel of the d20, especially when you can still roll a natural 1 at any level. I mean, would Legolas ever completely botch a bow shot like someone who’s never held one in their life? High level characters should succeed more and fail less! After exploring other systems, I found dice pools to be a better solution.

I've also never been a fan of complicated rules and modifiers. You roll the die, add your stat modifier, weapon bonus, feat bonus, and on and on and it just gets tedious. Games like [The Black Hack](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/255088/the-black-hack-second-edition) simplify things with a roll-under mechanic, which I found really appealing. But I wondered: how do you tweak difficulty without piling on modifiers and defeating the simplicity of the roll under mechanic? That’s why I came up with the Difficulty, where you roll under your stat *and* above the Difficulty. Simple, with no math needed!

Then there was combat — it didn’t feel dangerous enough. A knife-wielding stranger in an alley should be terrifying but 1d4 damage in most games is pathetic! That’s why I created [Deadly Weapons](https://jacobrex.itch.io/deadly-weapons), where all weapons use 1 to 6 d10s for damage using the highest roll. That way ever weapon has the potential to deal a lot of damage, making every fight feel more intense.

Lastly, there’s the issue of Armor Class and drawn-out combat. Playing through a 3-hour battles never felt worth it, especially when most of the time was spent waiting! With Limitless's Combat mechanic, you can determine who hits, who misses, and initiative in one roll. Plus, it adds an element of surprise by randomizing initiative each round! Combine that with [Deadly Weapons'](https://jacobrex.itch.io/deadly-weapons) active defense system, where you roll to defende against and reduce incoming damage, and suddenly even a scantily clad barbarian with a big sword is not defenseless!

I hope you enjoy Limitless as much as I do. Now go forth and make great games!
