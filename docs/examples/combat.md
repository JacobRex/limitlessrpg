# Example of Combat
In this example, we see how a round of combat can take place. Several interesting things happen in this combat illustrating the flexibility of Limitless:

* Characters all state what they plan to do at the start of the round and roll at the same time
* Initiative is determined by rolls from highest to lowest
* Magic is made on the fly rather than via spell, requiring some negotiation between player and GM
* A damage roll crits, showing how weapons can be lethal at a moments notice
* And the circumstances of an action change during combat

All of this makes combat in Limitless flexible, creative and fast!

**GM:** "We can do this, the easy way or the hard way" the bandit says as he and his companions draw their swords. Another raises a crossbow. "Now hand over them coins!" he shouts. What do you do?

**Knight:** I'll charge ahead and attack the guy in front!

**Thief:** I'll join the Knight and try and help him take down the big guy in front!

**GM:** Very well. You'll both check Agility for Combat.

**Marksman:** I take aim at the Bandit with the crossbow!

**GM:** Excellent! You'll make a Dexterity Check to take your shot.

**Sorcerer:** We don't need this trouble right now. Can I use magic to disarm them?

**GM:** How are you going to do that?

**Sorcerer:** Hmm, well my character is a bit of a pyro so... how about I heat them up til they're too hot to hold?

**GM:** Okay, I'll allow that for the metal weaons, but there are 3 of them and this seems like uncommon magic to me. Make your Charisma Check with 5 Difficulty. Alright, everyone ready? Roll!

*Everyone rolls at the same time*

**GM:** Alright who had the highest roll?

**Knight:** I think thats me... I rolled a 18 and a 15. I only have 14 Agility..

**GM:** Ouch, that means neither roll succeeds. So you charge forward with your sword and shield at the ready and take some swings. These bandits are better fighters than you thought and parry your blows and leave an opening for the guy in front to take a swing! He's going to make an attack roll against you and since you failed your Combat Check, you won't be able to use your shield. His Short Sword has 2 Attack Power so thats.. 3 and 8 so 8 damage combing at you in the (rolls d20 for Hit Location) ... arm!

**Knight:** Alright let's hope this Steel Armor pays off! I've got 4 Defense so thats... 1, 3, 2 and 5! So my Armor prevents 5 damage!

**GM:** Right! Okay, so the bandit thrusts his sword and it slips under your shoulder pauldron piercing your skin. You take 3 damage. Who's next after an 18?

**Marksman:** Me I think. I rolled a 13 and a 10 for my Dex Check to shoot. I have 14 Agility so both Succeed!

**GM:** Great! You let lose an arrow before the crossbowman can even react! Roll Damage!

**Marksman:** Okay, my bow has 2 Attack Power so for damage I got ... a 3 and a 10 at the... head!

**GM:** Excellent! Your 10 crits so give me another d10!

**Marksman:** Okay... a 4, so thats 10+4... 14 damage!

**GM:** Your arrow flies true and strikes him in the face! His head hurls back and you can see an arrow sticking up out of his eye! He falls over dead with a thud! Who's next after a 13?

**Sorcerer:** Me, I rolled a 9 and a 5 for my Charisma Check for magic. I have 13 Charisma so both Succeed!

**GM:** You raise your hands and shout an incantation and their weapons start to glow! "YARGH!" they scream dropping their swords! Each takes 1 damage as well. Now it's your turn Thief.

**Thief:** Okay, I rolled a 2 and an 8.

**GM:** Right, so that 2 *would* have been too low to pass the 3 Difficulty but now they have no weapons so I'll count your Combat Check as a full Successs.

**Thief:** Awesome! My shortsword has 2 Attack power so that so that's... 3 and 8 in the... chest!

**GM:** Okay, he has leather armor just 1 Defense which comes too... 3 so 5 damage gets through. You follow the knight into the fray and watch as the bandits clutch their hands and drop their hot swords on the ground. You seize the opportunity to strike the leader and make a slash down his front and strike his chest! He staggers backwards.

And so on...
