# How to Play
LIMITLESS is an OSR tabletop rpg played with paper, pencils, dice and a group of friends. One player becomes the Game Master (GM), guiding the adventure by describing the world and its challenges. Players create characters and decide how to interact with this world and use dice rolls to see what happens.

## Core Mechanic
Everything a player might possibly attempt that could result in failure is resolved with a Check. Checks are made by rolling 2d20 and comparing it to the Stat identified by the GM. Each die that rolled *below* the relevant Stat is counted as a Success.

| Successes | Outcome         |
|:----------|:----------------|
| 0         | Failure         |
| 1         | Partial Success |
| 2         | Success         |

The outcome of a Partial Success is determined by the GM based on the action and circumstances. In Combat for example, this could mean that you hit but the defender can use their shield, or perhaps you hit but are also struck. Ultimately, the GM will make a decision that keeps things moving and fun.

Non Player Character's (NPC's) never make Checks. Instead, the GM will set the scene and ask you to respond to it. You can choose to respond to the same situation in different ways depending on how you want to play your character, and your decision will determine the Check you make and it's difficulty. For example, when faced with an arrow trap you could: leap out of the way (Agility), raise your shield and brace for the hit (Endurance), swipe the arrow out of the air with your sword (Dexterity), and so on. See the Character Creation section for more information about Stats like Agility, Endurance and Dexterity.

### Intensity
A Check's Intensity is the highest number rolled in a Check. For example if a player rolled a 12 and a 4, the intensity of that check would be 12. Intensity can be used for various things, like resolving Partial Successes in Combat or determining Initiative.

### Difficulty
A Check's Difficulty is the lowest number a dice can roll and be counted as a Success. This means the dice in your pool only Succeed if they are below your Stat *and* above the Difficulty. This allows the DM to account for situations like cover, darkness, terrain, skilled enemies etc. For example a young squire facing an experienced swordsman might make their Combat checks with a difficulty of 5.

| Difficulty | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| 1          | Standard    |
| 2-5        | Difficult   |
| 6-10       | Challenging |
| 10+        | Daunting    |

Your GM may determine that a Check is impossible and no roll can be made.

### Ease
If an action is certain and there's no risk or time pressure, the GM shouldnâ€™t call for a Check.
