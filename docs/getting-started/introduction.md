# Introduction
After years of playing tabletop games, I kept running into the same frustrations: d20 rolls felt too binary and natural 1s & 20s made no sense. Why should a master archer have the same chance to total fail as a novice? I wanted a system where experience matters — so I built LIMITLESS around a 2d20 roll under mechanic.

I also ditched classes, skills, and spells. Players shouldn’t have to shoehorn their characters into predefined boxes. Instead, I designed a flexible stat system that lets you build whoever you want.

Math can slow a game to a crawl. I wanted something fast like [The Black Hack's](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/255088/the-black-hack-second-edition) roll-under system but with a way to adjust difficulty without piling on modifiers. That’s where Difficulty comes in: just roll under your stat and above the Difficulty. No math, no problem!

Hit points never felt right to me either. A knife in the hands of someone dangerous should be scary, not laughable. So I created [Deadly Weapons](https://jacobrex.itch.io/deadly-weapons), where weapons roll a d10 pool and take the highest roll with exploding die. Every hit can be deadly and every fight, meaningful.

Combat also needed a shake-up. Waiting around for your turn in a 3 hour slog just kills momentum. In LIMITLESS, a single roll handles attack, defense, and initiative making for streamlined and surprising combat every round.

And Armor C;ass? Why is it only provided by armor and shields? With [Deadly Weapons'](https://jacobrex.itch.io/deadly-weapons) defense system, armor provides passive defense and weapons & shields provide situational active defense. A barbarian in a loincloth with a sword is no longer defenseless!

LIMITLESS is the system I always wanted to play: fast, flexible, and deadly. I hope you enjoy it. Now go forth and make something epic!
