## Overview
LIMITLESS was written with these philosophies in mind.

### No Classes
Your Character's abilities are determined by their Stats and Equipment.

### No Skills
Simply describe what your Character does and the GM will determine the Check.

### No Levels
Your Stats have a chance to increase as you play, making levels uneccessary.

### No Waiting
Initiative is determined by Combat Checks each round making the battlefield fun & fast paced.

### No Math
Checks resolve when dice roll *over* & *under* target numbers, making Modifiers unecessary.

### Player Facing
Checks create degrees of success, allowing Players to make all the Checks.

### Deadly Combat
Every weapon has the potential to do lethal damage. When you are on the battlefield you are literally fighting for your life!

### Powerful Magic
Magic is mysterious & unweildly and requires Checks to cast. Failure results in hilarious or dangerous consequences!

### Open Sourced
LIMITLESS is released under the Open RPG Creative license (“ORC License”) for others to use.
