# Stamina, Recovery & Death
Stamina represents your character’s available energy, which can be spent to perform actions. At the start of each session, place a number of tokens equal to your Character’s Vitality in the Stamina pool.

Whenever you take an action that requires Stamina, such as weilding a weapon, blocking with a shield, running, climbing, etc, move the necessary amount of tokens from your Stamina pool to your Fatigue pool. If you have no remaining energy in your Stamina pool, you're unable to take the action.

## Fatigue
Fatigue represents energy your Character has expended fighting or performing physically or mentally challenging actions.

Fatigue returns to the Stamina pool with rest. You recover half your Vigor in Fatigue at the start of each round of Combat, or up to your Vigor in Fatigue if you do not move or attack on your turn. You recovery all your Fatigue after a 5 minute rest.

Each time you suffer damage, move that many tokens from Stamina to Fatigue. If there is more damage to suffer after moving all the Stamina from the Fatigue pool, move tokens from Stamina to the Burden pool instead.

## Burden
Burden represent harm to your character in the form of cuts, sprains, bruises, broken bones and stress. When all of your Stamina is in the Burden pool, your Character dies.

## Exhaustion
Exhaustion represents a more extreme kind of Fatigue that cannot be recovered with just a few moments of rest. Whenever your Stamina pool reaches 0, or when the GM calls for it, move Stamina to the Exhaustion pool. This Stamina can only be recovered with a nights rest.

## Recovery
After a nights rest, make a Vigor Check. Recover 1 Stamina from Burden for each Success rolled.
