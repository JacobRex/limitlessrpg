# Combat
When you engage in combat, the flow is simple and dynamic, resolving who strikes first and how the clash unfolds with a single Combat Check.

## The Agility Check
At the start of each Round, the GM sets the scene by describing what the NPCs are doing, what obstacles or threats are present, and the general flow of battle. Players then have 60 seconds to declare actions: fight, flee, rest, reposition, or improvise, etc. When ready, players make their Checks at the same time. For Combat, this will be a Strength or Dexterity check, depending on the Weapon. If a Player doesn’t declare an action within 60 seconds, their character hesitates and takes no action that turn.

| Successes | Outcome              |
|:----------|:---------------------|
| **0**     | Your opponent strikes and you must defend |
| **1**     | Think fast! The GM presents a choice |
| **2**     | You find an opening and attack |

Actions resolve in order of each Check's Intensity. Ties resolve simultaneously. If an NPC you targeted dies before your action resolves, tough!

## The Skirmish
If you’re the attacker, move energy from Stamina to Fatigue and make your Attack roll. Your opponent rolls Defense.

On only one success, the GM offers a tense choice reflecting the scene. You may trade hits, disengage safely, or take a risky action with possible consequences, spend additional Stamina or whatever the GM decides.

If you're the defender, spend energy and make a defense roll vs the enemy's attack roll.

## End of Exchange
Resolve damage by moving tokens to Fatigue or Burden as needed. Then, regain half your Vigor from Fatigue to Stamina. A new round immediately begins!

## Multiple Combatants
Your Combat Check gains +1 Difficulty for each additional enemy after the first.

When taking damage while engaged with multiple enemies, increase incoming damage by +1 for each enemy beyond the first.

> Example: You’re egnaging 4 enemies and suffer 2 damage. This would increase for the 3 additional enemies to 5.

## Movement & Distance
Combat uses abstract distances to simplify positioning. Expend energy to move to these spaces.

| Distance    | Approx. Range | Stamina                  |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Close**   | 1–10 paces    | 0                        |
| **Near**    | 10–20 paces   | 1-2                      |
| **Far**     | 20–50 paces   | 2-5+                     |
| **Distant** | 50+ paces     | N/A. Out of combat range |

## Ranged Combat

### Long Distance
The range of the target should affect the Difficulty of the shot at the GM's discretion.

### Cover
Cover increases the Difficulty of ranged attacks:

| Cover       | Difficulty |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| **0%-25%**  | 1          |
| **25%-50%** | 2-5        |
| **50%-75%** | 6-10       |
| **75%+**    | 10+        |
| **100%**    | Impossible |
