# Combat
When combat breaks out, gameplay is broken down into Rounds.

At the start of each Round, the GM sets the stage and explains what the NPCs are doing. Then, you and your teammates have 60 seconds to decide and say what you each plan to do that Round. When ready, everyone rolls their Checks at the same time. If you failed to state what you do, your Charactr  has hesitated and you get no action this turn.

Everyone's actions are resolved in the order of Intensity, with ties happening simulataneously. 

## Movement & Distance
The battlefield is broken into abstract distances of Close, Nearby, Far and Distant. You are actively enagaged in Combat with Close enemies. You can move to a Close or Nearby space as part of an action on your turn, peforming your action anywhere on that turn. Moving Far takes an entire turn. Distant Combatants have left the battlefield and would require a check to catch up to or find.

On your turn you can move somewhere **Nearby** as part of an action, performing that action at any stage of your move. You can forgo your action and move somewhere **Far-Away** instead. Anything beyond **Far-Away** can be classified as **Distant**.

| Close     | Nearby     | Far away    | Distant   |
|:---------:|:----------:|:-----------:|:---------:|
| 1-5 paces | 5-20 paces | 20-50 paces | 50+ paces |

## Example of Play

sorcerer 5/9
thief 2/8

**GM:** "We can do this, the easy way or the hard way" the bandit says as he and his companions draw their swords. Another raises a crossbow. "Now hand over them coins!" he shouts. What do you do?

**Knight:** I'll charge ahead and attack the guy in front!

**Thief:** I'll join the Knight and try and help him take down the big guy in front!

**GM:** Very well. You'll both check Agility for your Attack. Since theres 4 of them, but you each have one companion with you, that check will have a Difficulty of 3.

**Marksman:** I take aim at the Bandit with the crossbow!

**GM:** Excellent! You'll make a Dexterity Check to take your shot.

**Sorcerer:** We don't need this trouble right now. Can I use magic to make them drop their weapons?

**GM:** How are you going to do that?

**Sorcerer:** How about I make them heat up til they're too hot to hold?

**GM:** Okay, I'll allow that for the metal weaons, but there are 3 of them and this seems like uncommon magic to me. Make a Charisma check with 5 Difficulty. Alright, everyone ready? Roll!

*Everyone rolls at the same time*

**GM:** Alright who had the highest roll?

**Knight:** I think thats me... I rolled a 18 and a 15.

**GM:** Ouch, since your Agility is a 14, neither roll succeeds. So you charge forward with your sword and shield at the ready and take some swings. These bandits are better fighters than you thought and parry your blows and leave an opening for the guy in front to take a swing! He's going to make an attack roll against you and since you failed your Combat Check, you won't be able to use your shield. His Short Sword does 2d10 so thats.. 3 and 8 so 8 damage combing at you in the ... arm.

**Knight:** Alright let's hope this Steel Armor pays off! I've got 4 Defense so thats 4d6... 1, 3, 2 and 5! So my Armor prevents 5 damage!

**GM:** Right! Okay, so the bandit thrusts his sword and it slips under your shoulder pauldron piercing your skin. You take 3 damage. Who's next after an 18?

**Marksman:** Me I think. I rolled a 13 and a 10. I have 14 Agility so both Succeed!

**GM:** Great! You let lose an arrow before the crossbowman can react! Roll Damage

**Marksman:** Okay, my bow does 2d10 so for damage I got ... a 3 and a 10 at the... head!

**GM:** Excellent! Gimme one more d10!

**Marksman:** Okay... a 4, so thats 14 damage!

**GM:** Your arrow flies true and strikes him in the face and as his head hurls back you can see an arrow sticking up out of his eye! He falls over with a thud! Who's next after a 13?

**Sorcerer:** Me, I got a 5 and a 9. I have 13 Charisma so both Succeed!

**GM:** You raise your hands and shout an incantation and their weapons glow bright red! "YARGH!" they scream dropping their swords! Each takes 1 damage as well. So that leaves?

**Thief:** Me, I rolled a 2 and an 8.

**GM:** Right, so that 2 would have been too low to pass the 3 Difficulty but now they have no weapons so I'll count that Combat Check as a Successs.

**Thief:** Awesome, going last isn't so bad then! My shortsword does 2d10 so that's ...3 and 8 at the ... chest!

**GM:** Okay, he has leather armor and a shield so thats 2 Defense total which comes too... 2 and 3 so 5 damage gets through. You follow the knight into the fray and see the bandits clutch their hands as they drop their hot swords on the ground. You seize the opportunity to strike the leader and make a slash down his front and strike his chest!

And so on...
