# Combat
At the start of each Round, the GM sets the scene by describing what the NPCs are doing, what obstacles or threats are present, and the general flow of battle. Players then have 60 seconds to declare actions: fight, flee, rest, reposition, or improvise, etc. When ready, players rolls their Checks at the same time. If a player doesn’t declare an action within 60 seconds, their character hesitates and takes no action that turn.

Actions resolve in order of each Check's Intensity. Ties resolve simultaneously. If an NPC you targeted dies before your action resolves, tough!

## Engaging in Combat
Spend Stamina up to the weapon's attack, this will be how much damage you do if you hit or how much defense you have. Move those tokens to your Fatigue pool, then roll your weapon’s Combat Check (usually Strength, Agility, or Dexterity). This Check determines if you are the attacker or defender in the coming skirmish:

| Successes | Outcome              |
|:----------|:---------------------|
| 0         | You are the defender |
| 1         | GM choice |
| 2         | You are the attacker |

### Resolving the Skirmish
If you’re the attacker, roll Attack (based on how much Stamina you spent). The GM will simultaneously roll your opponent's Defense.

If you’re the defender, you may spend Stamina to activate your weapon or shield’s defenses, then you'll roll Defense for your weapons, shields and armor vs your opponent's Attack

After both rolls, apply damage, update Fatigue, and track any Injuries.

### Multiple Combatants
Facing multiple enemies is dangerous. Your Combat Check gains +1 Difficulty for each additional enemy after the first. When taking damage while engaged with multiple enemies, increase incoming damage by +1 per extra enemy.

> Example: You’re fighting 4 enemies and take 2 damage → becomes 5 damage.


## Ranged Combat
To fire a bow, spend 1 Stamina, plus any additional Stamina you want to invest in your weapon's attack roll. Then make a Ranged Combat Check (typically Dexterity). Crossbows require Stamina to reload, but not to fire.

| Successes | Outcome   |
|:----------|:----------|
| 0         | Miss      |
| 1         | GM choice |
| 2         | Hit       |

If you hit, roll Attack vs enemy Defense, then roll your usage die.

On a GM-chosen result, you might require extra stamina, hit a nearby ally, or damage your bow. It’s up to the GM, the scene, and your narration.

## Movement & Distance
Combat uses abstract distances to simplify positioning:

| Distance | Approx. Range | Notes                                                |
| -------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Close    | 1–10 paces    | You are actively **engaged** in melee                |
| Near     | 10–20 paces   | Requires spending 1 Stamina to make an Agility Check |
| Far      | 20–50 paces   | Requires full turn to reach                          |
| Distant  | 50+ paces     | Out of combat range.                                 |

### Agility Check
| Successes | Outcome   |
|:----------|:----------|
| 0         | You reach the space but your turn ends |
| 1         | You reach the space and can act if you spend an additional Stamina |
| 2         | You reach the space and can act       |



















To fight move 1 Stamina token plus any additional Stamina you wish to invest in your weapon’s attack into the Fatigue pool. Then make the Check for your weapon (Strength, Agility, Dex etc) to determine whether you're the attacker or defender this round.



### Resolving the Skirmish
If you are the attacker, roll damage vs the enemy's defense using the attack pool based on how much Stamina you spent.

If you are the defender, you may choose to spend Stamina to activate your weapon or shield’s Defense. Then roll Defense vs the enemy's Attack to reduce incoming damage. Remember, Armor provides passive protection and always applies.

After the skirmish is resolved, apply damage and update Stamina, Fatigue, and Injury as needed.

## Multiple Combatants
Combat Checks get +1 Difficulty for each enemy after the first. For example, if you are engaging 3 enemies at once, the Difficulty for that Check is increased by 2.

When resolving skirmish while engaged with multiple enemies, the damage is increased by 1 for each enemy after the first. For example, if you are engaging four enemies and suffer 1 damage, the damage would be increased by +3 to 4.

## Ranged Combat
To attack with a bow move 1 Stamina token plus any additional Stamina you wish to invest in your bow's attack into the Fatigue pool. Crossbows spend stamina to reload but not to attack. Then make your ranged combat check.

| Successes | Outcome   |
|:----------|:----------|
| 0         | Miss      |
| 1         | GM choice |
| 2         | Hit       |

### Resolving the Shot
If you hit, roll damage vs the enemy's defense and then roll your usage die.

GM's choice could be to require extra stamina, an additional roll of the usage die, or whatever best fits the narrative. They may also determine that you inadvertently hit another player in the same zone.

## Movement & Distance
The battlefield is broken into abstract distances of Close, Near, Far and Distant. You are actively enagaged in Combat with Close enemies. You can move to a Close or Nearby space as part of an action on your turn, peforming your action anywhere on that turn. Moving Far takes an entire turn. Distant Combatants have left the battlefield and would require a check to catch up to or find.

On your turn you can move somewhere **Near** as part of an action, performing that action at any stage of your move. You can forgo your action and move somewhere **Far** instead. Anything beyond **Far** is considered **Distant**.

| Close      | Near        | Far         | Distant   |
|:----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:---------:|
| 1-10 paces | 10-20 paces | 20-50 paces | 50+ paces |

### Range
The range of the target should affect the Difficulty of the shot at the GM's discretion. See [Movement & Distance](/rules/combat.html#movement-distance) for more information.

### Cover
Cover increases the Difficulty of ranged attacks:

| Cover   | Difficulty |
| ------- | ---------- |
| 0%-25%  | 1          |
| 25%-50% | 2-5        |
| 50%-75% | 6-10       |
| 75%+    | 10+        |
| 100%    | Impossible |
