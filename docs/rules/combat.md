# Combat
When you engage in combat, the flow is simple and dynamic, resolving who strikes first and how the clash unfolds with a single Agility check.

## The Agility Check
At the start of each Round, the GM sets the scene by describing what the NPCs are doing, what obstacles or threats are present, and the general flow of battle. Players then have 60 seconds to declare actions: fight, flee, rest, reposition, or improvise, etc. When ready, players make their Checks at the same time. If a player doesn’t declare an action within 60 seconds, their character hesitates and takes no action that turn.

| Successes | Outcome              |
|:----------|:---------------------|
| **0**     | Your opponent strikes first, and you must defend |
| **1**     | The situation is uncertain. The GM presents a choice |
| **2**     | You find an opening and attack |

Actions resolve in order of each Check's Intensity. Ties resolve simultaneously. If an NPC you targeted dies before your action resolves, tough!

## The Skirmish
If you’re the attacker, expend as much Energy as you like up to your weapon’s limit, to roll that many d10s for your attack pool. Your opponent rolls their defense pool based on their armor and energy spent, using d6s. Compare the highest dice results to determine damage and whether your attack succeeds.

If the situation is uncertain, the GM offers a tense choice reflecting the scene. You may trade hits, disengage safely, or take a risky action with possible consequences or whatever the GM decides.

If you're the defender, the opponent spend Energy and then make a defense roll vs the enemy's attack roll.

## End of Exchange
Resolve damage by moving energy tokens to Fatigue or Wounds as needed. Then, regain half your Vigor of Energy from Fatigue to Life. A new round immediately begins!

## Multiple Combatants
Your Combat Check gains +1 Difficulty for each additional enemy after the first.

When taking damage while engaged with multiple enemies, increase incoming damage by +1 for each enemy beyond the first.

> Example: You’re egnaging 4 enemies and suffer 2 damage. This would increase for the 3 additional enemies to 5.

## Movement & Distance
Combat uses abstract distances to simplify positioning. Expend energy to move to these spaces.

| Distance    | Approx. Range | Life                     |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Close**   | 1–10 paces    | 0                        |
| **Near**    | 10–20 paces   | 1-2                      |
| **Far**     | 20–50 paces   | 3+                       |
| **Distant** | 50+ paces     | N/A. Out of combat range |



















To fight move 1 Life token plus any additional Life you wish to invest in your weapon’s attack into the Fatigue pool. Then make the Check for your weapon (Strength, Agility, Dex etc) to determine whether you're the attacker or defender this round.



### Resolving the Skirmish
If you are the attacker, roll damage vs the enemy's defense using the attack pool based on how much Life you spent.

If you are the defender, you may choose to spend Life to activate your weapon or shield’s Defense. Then roll Defense vs the enemy's Attack to reduce incoming damage. Remember, Armor provides passive protection and always applies.

After the skirmish is resolved, apply damage and update Life, Fatigue, and Injury as needed.

## Multiple Combatants
Combat Checks get +1 Difficulty for each enemy after the first. For example, if you are engaging 3 enemies at once, the Difficulty for that Check is increased by 2.

When resolving skirmish while engaged with multiple enemies, the damage is increased by 1 for each enemy after the first. For example, if you are engaging four enemies and suffer 1 damage, the damage would be increased by +3 to 4.

## Ranged Combat
To attack with a bow move 1 Life token plus any additional Life you wish to invest in your bow's attack into the Fatigue pool. Crossbows spend Life to reload but not to attack. Then make your ranged combat check.

| Successes | Outcome   |
|:----------|:----------|
| **0**     | Miss      |
| **1**     | GM choice |
| **2**     | Hit       |

### Resolving the Shot
If you hit, roll damage vs the enemy's defense and then roll your usage die.

GM's choice could be to require extra Life, an additional roll of the usage die, or whatever best fits the narrative. They may also determine that you inadvertently hit another player in the same zone.

## Movement & Distance
The battlefield is broken into abstract distances of Close, Near, Far and Distant. You are actively enagaged in Combat with Close enemies. You can move to a Close or Nearby space as part of an action on your turn, peforming your action anywhere on that turn. Moving Far takes an entire turn. Distant Combatants have left the battlefield and would require a check to catch up to or find.

On your turn you can move somewhere **Near** as part of an action, performing that action at any stage of your move. You can forgo your action and move somewhere **Far** instead. Anything beyond **Far** is considered **Distant**.

| Close      | Near        | Far         | Distant   |
|:----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:---------:|
| 1-10 paces | 10-20 paces | 20-50 paces | 50+ paces |

### Range
The range of the target should affect the Difficulty of the shot at the GM's discretion. See [Movement & Distance](/rules/combat.html#movement-distance) for more information.

### Cover
Cover increases the Difficulty of ranged attacks:

| Cover   | Difficulty |
| ------- | ---------- |
| 0%-25%  | **1**      |
| 25%-50% | 2-5        |
| 50%-75% | 6-10       |
| 75%+    | 10+        |
| 100%    | Impossible |
