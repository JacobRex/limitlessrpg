# Combat
When combat breaks out, gameplay is broken down into Rounds.

At the start of each Round, the GM sets the stage and explains what the NPCs are doing. Then, you and your teammates have 60 seconds to decide and say what you each plan to do that Round. When ready, everyone rolls their Checks at the same time. If you failed to state what you do, your Charactr  has hesitated and you get no action this turn.

Everyone's actions are resolved in the order of Intensity, with ties happening simulataneously. 

## Movement & Distance
The battlefield is broken into abstract distances of Close, Nearby, Far and Distant. You are actively enagaged in Combat with Close enemies. You can move to a Close or Nearby space as part of an action on your turn, peforming your action anywhere on that turn. Moving Far takes an entire turn. Distant Combatants have left the battlefield and would require a check to catch up to or find.

On your turn you can move somewhere **Nearby** as part of an action, performing that action at any stage of your move. You can forgo your action and move somewhere **Far-Away** instead. Anything beyond **Far-Away** can be classified as **Distant**.

| Close     | Nearby     | Far away    | Distant   |
|:---------:|:----------:|:-----------:|:---------:|
| 1-5 paces | 5-20 paces | 20-50 paces | 50+ paces |

## Multiple Combatants
Combat Checks get +1 Difficulty for each enemy after the first. For example, if you are engaging 3 enemies at once, the Difficulty for that Check is increased by +2 to 3 Difficulty.

When taking melee damage while engaged with multiple enemies, the damage is increased by 1 for each enemy after the first. For example, if you are engaging 4 enemies and suffer 5 damage, the damage would be increased by +3 to 8 for the 3 enemies beyond the first.
