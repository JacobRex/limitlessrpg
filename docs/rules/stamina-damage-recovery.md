# Stamina, Damage & Recovery
There are no Hit Points in LIMITLESS. Instead, your Character has Stamina, which represents your character's ability to perform actions. 

## Stamina Pool
Your Stamina Pool represents your character's ability to perform actions. A full Stamina Pool means your character is energized and ready for anything.

## Fatigue Pool
Your Fatigue Pool represents Stamina your character has expended fighting or performing physically or mentally trying actions. Stamina from this pool returns to the Stamina Pool with rest.

## Injury Pool
The Injury Pool represents harm like cuts, bruises, breaks, or other trauma that limits your ability to function. All Checks are made with a Difficulty equal to your Injury pool (rounded down).

## Using Stamina
Whenever you take an action that requires Stamina, move that many tokens from your Stamina Pool to your Fatigue Pool. If your Stamina reserve is empty, you're unable to take the action.

During combat, every action like attacking, defending, shooting, climbing, etc has a stamina cost because things are done without time for breaks. Outside Combat, spent Stamina might serve as a ceiling for exhaustion, hunger, thirst etc until the source of the exhaustion is managed.

## Taking Damage
Whenever you suffer damage, move that many tokens from your Stamina pool to your Fatigue pool. If your Stamina reserve is empty or runs out, move tokens from Fatigue to the Injury pool instead.

## Exhaustion
Every time your stamina pool reaches 0, your max stamina is decreased by 1. Move a stamina token off your character sheet. 

## Recovery During Combat
At the Start of each round of Combat, you recover Stamina equal to your Vigor/3 rounded down.

You can choose to catch your breath and recover all your Fatigued Stamina but you canâ€™t move or attack during this turn.

## Recovery Outside Combat
Outside Combat you may rest for one day, then make a Vigor Check. Recover 1 Stamina from Exhaustion or Injury per success.

## Death
When all of your Stamina is moved to the Injury pool, you are dead.
