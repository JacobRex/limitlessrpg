# Damage & Recovery
Damage rolls always involve rolling a d20 to determine where the hit landed. Below is the hit location tables for humanoids.

| D20   | Location |
|:----- |:-------- |
| 20    | Any      |
| 18-19 | Head     |
| 11-17 | Body     | 
| 6-10  | Arms     |
| 1-5   | Legs     |

## Taking Damage
Taking Damage causes you to lose HP. Think of this as an abstract measure of your ability fight and carry on, rather than a specific injury. 

### Knockout (KO)
When your HP is reduded to 0, you are KO'd. A KO'd character is unconscious, helpless and can do nothing other than attempt to recover from KO. Upon being KO'd you immediately suffer an Injury decided by the GM based on where you were hit and the damage type. For example, perhaps you have a broken leg, a deep wound, or a missing finger. An Injury lowers your max HP by 5 and increases the Difficulty of all Checks by 2. If a KO would drop your Max HP to zero or below, you die.

#### Recover From KO
After Combat has ended, or if a player spends their turn assisting you, make a VIG Check:

| Successes | Outcome |
|:----------|:--------|
| 0         | You are still KO'd. Try again in 30 minutes. |
| 1         | You wake up with 1d6 HP, or your max HP if it is lower |
| 2         | You wake up with your max HP |

### Staggered
Whenever you take damage equal to or greater than 1/2 your END in a single blow, or are struck in the groin, throat or head you are Staggered. While Staggered, you cannot move or utilize active defenses and begin each of your turns with a VIG Check:

| Successes | Outcome |
|:----------|:--------|
| 0         | You are still Staggered |
| 1         | You are no longer Staggered but cannot move or take any offensive action this turn |
| 2         | You are no longer Staggered and take your turn as normal |

### Lethal Blows
Whenever take damage equal to or greater than your END in a single blow you have suffered a Lethal Blow:

| Hit Location | Outcome                                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Head         | You die instantly                                        |
| Body         | You die but you can give a death speech                  |
| Arms or Legs | You are maimed or dismembered. Suffer 1 permanent Injury and KO |

### Coup De Grace
An attack against a helpless opponent may target any location and be lethal if the attacker desires.
