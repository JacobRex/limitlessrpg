# Damage & Recovery
Damage rolls always involve rolling a d20 to determine where the hit landed. Below is the hit location tables for humanoids.

| D20   | Location | Poise |
|:----- |:-------- |:-----:|
| 20    | Any      | -     |
| 18-19 | Head     | 3     |
| 10-17 | Body     | 4     |
| 6-9   | Arms     | 4     |
| 1-5   | Legs     | 5     |

### Poise and Damage
Poise represents your ability to withstand damage without being Wounded. It acts as a threshold:

| Damage   | Effect    |
| -------- | --------- |
| < Poise  | Staggered |
| = Poise  | 1 Wound   |
| 2x Poise | 2 Wound   |
| 3x Poise | 3 Wounds  |

### Staggered
Staggering occurs whenever you take damage, regardless of its severity. It represents a temporary disruption, such as being knocked off balance or interrupted. While Staggered, you cannot move or utilize active defenses and begin each of your turns with a Vigor Check:

| Successes | Outcome |
|:----------|:--------|
| 0         | You are still Staggered |
| 1         | You are no longer Staggered but cannot move or take any offensive action this turn |
| 2         | You are no longer Staggered and take your turn as normal |

### Wounds
Wounds are the result of damage exceeding your Poise. They represent an actual Injury to your person that hinders your ability to function, such as a cut or broken bone. Each Wound you suffer increases the Burden by 2.

### Knockout (KO)
Whenever a Wound causes a body part to reach or exceed its maximum Wound level, you are KO'd. Immediately make a Vigor check:

| Successes | Outcome                                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0         | Instant death for hits to the head; otherwise, a death speech is allowed |
| 1         | You suffer 1 Permanent Wound                                             |
| 2         | You remain KO'd but gain no permanent Wounds                             |

If a body part ever becomes fully inflicted with Permanent Wounds, you die.

### Coup De Grace
An attack against a helpless opponent may target any location and be lethal if the attacker desires.

## Recovery
After resting with proper accommodations for a number of weeks equal to your Wounds, make a Vigor check. You recover 1 Wound for each Success.
