# Core Mechanic
Whenever you attempt to do something in game with a consequence of failure, roll 2d20. Each die that rolled *below* the relevant Stat determined by your GM is counted as a Success.

| Successes | Outcome           |
|:----------|:------------------|
| 0         | Failure           |
| 1         | Success at a cost |
| 2         | Success           |

The outcome of a "Success at a cost" is determined by the GM based on the action and circumstances. This could mean that you pick the lock but break your tool, leap over the chasm but drop an item, or whatever fits the narrative.

Non Player Character's (NPC's) should never make Checks. Instead, the GM will set the scene and ask **you** to respond to it. How you choose to respond will change how the GM might ask you to make your Check. For example, when faced with an arrow trap you could: leap out of the way, raise your shield and brace for the hit, swipe the arrow out of the air with your sword, stop it in mid-air with magic, and so on. Each could call for a different kind of roll that your GM determines, leading to all sorts of possibilities.

## Difficulty
A Check's Difficulty is the lowest number a dice can roll and be counted as a Success. This means the dice in your pool only Succeed if they are less than your Stat *and* greater than the Difficulty. This allows the DM to account for situations like cover, darkness, terrain, skilled enemies etc. For example a young squire facing an experienced swordsman might make their Combat checks with a difficulty of 5.

| Difficulty | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| 1          | Standard    |
| 2-5        | Difficult   |
| 6-10       | Challenging |
| 10+        | Daunting    |

Your GM may determine that a Check is simply impossible and no roll can be made.

## Intensity
A Check's Intensity is the highest number rolled in a Check. For example if a player rolled a 12 and a 4, the intensity of that check would be 12. Intensity is used for various things, such as determining Initiative in Combat, tie breakers, and so on.
