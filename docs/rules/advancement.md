# Advancement
The GM will award 1-3 Valor at certain milestones within the game or as a reward for good roleplaying. You may spend Valor to do one of the following:

### Increase Stats
Outside of Combat, spend 1 Valor to attempt to increase your Stats. Choose a Stat and roll d20. The Stat increases by 1 permanently if you roll higher than it. 18 is the max value for any Stat.

### Reroll
You may spend 1 Valor at any time to reroll a failed Check, reroll Damage, or reroll Defense. You must take the new result.
