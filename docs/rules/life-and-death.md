# Life and Death

## Life
Life represents your character’s available energy, which can be spent to perform actions. At the start of each session, place a number of tokens equal to your Character’s Vitality in the Life pool.

Whenever you take an action that requires energy, such as weilding a weapon, blocking with a shield, running, climbing, etc, move the necessary amount of tokens from your Life pool to your Fatigue pool. If you have no remaining energy in your Life pool, you're unable to take the action.

## Fatigue
Fatigue represents energy your Character has expended fighting or performing physically or mentally challenging actions. Fatigue returns to the Life pool with rest.

Each time you suffer damage, move that many tokens from Life to Fatigue. If there is more damage to suffer after moving all the Life from the Fatigue pool, move tokens from Life to the Wound pool instead.

## Wounds
Wounds represent physical harm to your character in the form of cuts, bruises or broken bones.

When all of your Life is in the Wound pool, your Character dies.

## Exhaustion
Every time your Life reaches 0, your Max Life is decreased by 1. Move a token off your character sheet. This energy can only be recovered with rest.

## Recovery
After resting for one night, make a Vigor Check. Recover 1 Life from Wounds or Exhaustion for each success rolled.
