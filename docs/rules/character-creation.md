# Character Creation
To create a Character, [Roll Stats](#roll-stats), select a [Profession](#professions), and purchase [Equipment](#buy-equipment).

## Roll Stats
Stats are generated by rolling 3d6 nine times and assigning each result as desired to [Strength](/rules/stats/#strength), [Agility](/rules/stats/#agility), [Dexterity](/rules/stats/#dexterity), [Vitality](/rules/stats/#vitality), [Vigor](/rules/stats/#vigor), [Endurance](/rules/stats/#endurance), [Intelligence](/rules/stats/#intelligence), [Wisdom](/rules/stats/#wisdom), and [Charisma](/rules/stats/#charisma).

## Professions
Professions determine your Characters starting Equipment and Stat Bonuses, but do not lock them in to a style of play. Below are some examples to get you started. Work with your GM to determine what Professions are available to you.
