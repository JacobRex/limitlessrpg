# Equipment
Equipment refers to Weapons, Armor, and Shields and Gear that may be held or equipped by your Character. LIMITLESS doesn't prevent you from using any piece of equipment, but you will need to factor in Might and your Load limit to properly utilize Equipment.

### Attack
Attack is a measure of how effective a weapon is at doing damage. The range represents how much damge it does base for 1 stamina and how many it can do when boosted (1 per stamina). The damage dealt by a weapon is the highest of Xd10 where X is the weapon's Attack. If the highest number in the damage pool is a 10, add 1d10 to the damage. Repeat this until something other than a 10 is rolled.

### Defense
Defense prevents incoming damage and is rolled at the same time as damage rolls. The damage prevented is the highest of Xd6 where X is the defendants total Defense. If the highest number in the defense pool is a 6, add 1d6 to the Defense. Repeat this until something other than a 6 is rolled. If a Defense roll is equal to or higher than an Attack roll, then the attack has been completely deflected.

### Usage
Usage is a simplified manner of keeping track of how much of a consumable item or ammunition remains. This will be represented by some die ranging from d4-d20. Whenever you use that item, roll its usage die. If the die rolled a 1 or 2, then the die goes down by one size from d20 > d12 > d10 > d8 > d6 > d4. When a 1 or 2 is rolled on a d4, then item is spent and no more of it remains.
