# Equipment
Equipment refers to Weapons, Armor, and Shields and Gear that may be held or equipped by your Character. Limitless doesn't prevent you from using any piece of equipment, but you will need to meet that Equipment's STR and DEX requirements to use it without Penalty. Your Burden is increased for each point in the Requirements you fail to meet for your weapons and armor.

## Glossary

### Attack Power
Attack Power (ATP) is a measure of how effective a weapon is at doing damage. The damage dealt by a weapon is the highest of Xd10 where X is the weapon's Attack Power. If the highest number in the damage pool is a 10, add 1d10 to the damage. Repeat this until something other than a 10 is rolled.

### Defense
Defense prevents incoming damage and is rolled at the same time as Attack. The damage prevented is the highest of Xd6 where X is the defendants total Defense. If the highest number in the defense pool is a 6, add 1d6 to the Defense. Repeat this until something other than a 6 is rolled. If a Defense roll is higher than an Attack roll, then the defender has made a Counter Attack with the surplus defense. See the Combat section for more information.

### Usage
Usage is a simplified manner of keeping track of how much of a consumable item or ammunition remains. This will be represented by some die ranging from d4-d20. Whenever you use that item, roll its usage die. If the die rolled a 1 or 2, then the die goes down by one size from d20 > d12 > d10 > d8 > d6 > d4. When a 1 or 2 is rolled on a d4, then item is spent and no more of it remains.

## Melee Weapons

#### Attacking
Characters engage in Melee combat by making either an Agility, Strength or Dexterity Checks to determine who is the attacker and defender. The Stat they chose to use changes *how* they're using their weapon which affects the weapon's Attack Power and could have narrative impact at the GM's discretion.

* **Agility**: for speed and finesse, focusing on quick strikes
* **Strength**: powerful, heavy swings or thrusts. (This requires two handing the weapon)
* **Dexterity**: focused and precise attacks

| Successes | Outcome                                   |
|:----------|:------------------------------------------|
| 0         | You are defender, with only passive defenses |
| 1         | Partial success at GM's discretion        |
| 2         | You are the attacker, and defender may only use passive defenses |

See the [Combat](rules/combat) section for more information.

#### Defending
Melee weapons can be used in lieu of Shields to defend against incoming damage from melee attacks when the target is able to defend. So long as a character is armed with a melee weapon and ready and able to defend, they have 1 Defense.

#### Two Handing
When a Melee Weapon is held in both hands, its Strength requirement is reduced by 3.

## Ranged Weapons
Unlike melee weapons, which can be used one handed or two handed, ranged weapons always require two hands and ammunition to operare and posses no melee capabilities.

#### Attacking
Characters attack with ranged weapons by making a Dexterity Checks and by rolling the Usage die for their ammunition.

| Successes | Outcome                              |
|:----------|:-------------------------------------|
| 0         | Miss                                 |
| 1         | You hit but the target can Defend    |
| 2         | You hit and the target cannot Defend |

#### Range
The range of the target determines the Difficulty of the shot. See [Movement & Distance](/rules/combat#movement-distance) for more information.

| Name    | Difficulty               |
|:--------|:------------------------ |
| Close   | Difficult                 |
| Nearby  | Standard                 |
| Far     | Difficult to Challenging |
| Distant | Daunting                 |

#### Cover
Cover increases the Difficulty of ranged attacks:

| Cover   | Difficulty  |
| ------- | ----------- |
| 0-10%   | Standard    |
| 10-50%  | Difficult   |
| 50%-75% | Challenging |
| 75%+    | Daunting    |
| 100%    | Impossible  |

#### Called Shots
You can choose location to target prior to making your Combat Check, but it will introduce a Difficulty determined by the GM.

### Bows

| Warbow         | 3   | 14      | 12      |

### Crossbows
Unlike bows, crossbows use a bolt and are fired mechanically, so they need less Strength and Dexterity to use effectively. However, once fired, they will need to be reloaded. Reloading a crossbow takes one round or 2 rounds for the Heavy Crossbow.

| Bows            | ATP | REQ STR | REQ DEX |

## Armor
