# Equipment
Equipment refers to Weapons, Armor, and Shields and Gear that may be held or equipped by your Character. Limitless doesn't prevent you from using any piece of equipment, but you will need to meet that Equipment's STR and DEX requirements to use it without Penalty. Your Burden is increased for each point in the Requirements you fail to meet for your weapons and armor.

## Glossary

### Attack Power
Attack Power (ATP) is a measure of how effective a weapon is at doing damage. The damage dealt by a weapon is the highest of Xd10 where X is the weapon's Attack Power. If the highest number in the damage pool is a 10, add 1d10 to the damage. Repeat this until something other than a 10 is rolled.

### Defense
Defense prevents incoming damage and is rolled at the same time as Attack. The damage prevented is the highest of Xd6 where X is the defendants total Defense. If the highest number in the defense pool is a 6, add 1d6 to the Defense. Repeat this until something other than a 6 is rolled. If a Defense roll is higher than an Attack roll, then the defender has made a Counter Attack with the surplus defense. See the Combat section for more information.

### Usage
Usage is a simplified manner of keeping track of how much of a consumable item or ammunition remains. This will be represented by some die ranging from d4-d20. Whenever you use that item, roll its usage die. If the die rolled a 1 or 2, then the die goes down by one size from d20 > d12 > d10 > d8 > d6 > d4. When a 1 or 2 is rolled on a d4, then item is spent and no more of it remains.

## Melee Weapons

#### Attacking
An Agility check determines if you're the attacker and defender for that Round. This is a wide ranging check that accounts for your ability to dodge, weave, strike, parry, block, and more until a critical moment occurs when one of you finds an opening and takes it.

| Successes | Outcome              |
|:----------|:---------------------|
| 0         | You are the defender |
| 1         | GM's choice          |
| 2         | You are the attacker |

See the [Combat](/rules/combat) section for more information.

| 1         | You hit but the target can Defend    |
| 2         | You hit and the target cannot Defend |

#### Range
The range of the target should affect the Difficulty of the shot at the GM's discretion. See [Movement & Distance](/rules/combat.html#movement-distance) for more information.

#### Cover
Cover increases the Difficulty of ranged attacks:

| Cover   | Difficulty |
