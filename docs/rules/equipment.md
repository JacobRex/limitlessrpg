# Equipment
Equipment refers to Weapons, Armor, and Shields and Gear that may be held or equipped by your Character. LIMITLESS doesn't prevent you from using any piece of equipment, but you will need to factor in Might and your Load limit to properly utilize Equipment.

## Glossary

#### Armor
Armor passively increases the Poise of the body part it protects, making it less likely to become Wounded when struck. This makes Armor absolutely essential for Combat.

#### Attack Power
Attack Power (ATP) is a measure of how effective a weapon is at doing damage. The damage dealt by a weapon is the highest of Xd10 where X is the weapon's Attack Power. If the highest number in the damage pool is a 10, add 1d10 to the damage. Repeat this until something other than a 10 is rolled.

#### Damage Scaling
Weapon Damage is based on the Rank of the Stat it scales with. Your damage with that weapon will be the weapon's ATP or the relevant Stat's Rank, whichever is lower.

#### Defense
Defense prevents incoming damage and is rolled at the same time as damage rolls. The damage prevented is the highest of Xd6 where X is the defendants total Defense. If the highest number in the defense pool is a 6, add 1d6 to the Defense. Repeat this until something other than a 6 is rolled. If a Defense roll is equal to or higher than an Attack roll, then the attack has been completely deflected.

#### Usage
Usage is a simplified manner of keeping track of how much of a consumable item or ammunition remains. This will be represented by some die ranging from d4-d20. Whenever you use that item, roll its usage die. If the die rolled a 1 or 2, then the die goes down by one size from d20 > d12 > d10 > d8 > d6 > d4. When a 1 or 2 is rolled on a d4, then item is spent and no more of it remains.

## Melee Weapons

#### Defending
Melee weapons can be used in lieu of Shields to defend against incoming damage from melee attacks when the target is able to defend. So long as a character is armed with a melee weapon and ready and able to defend, they have 1 Defense. See [Combat](/rules/combat) for more information about defending.

## Ranged Weapons
Ranged weapons require two hands and ammunition to operare and posses no melee capabilities.

### Range
The range of the target should affect the Difficulty of the shot at the GM's discretion. See [Movement & Distance](/rules/combat.html#movement-distance) for more information.

#### Cover
Cover increases the Difficulty of ranged attacks:

| Cover   | Difficulty |
| ------- | ---------- |
| 0%-25%  | 1          |
| 25%-50% | 2-5        |
| 50%-75% | 6-10       |
| 75%+    | 10+        |
| 100%    | Impossible |

#### Called Shots
You can choose location to target prior to making your Combat Check, but it will introduce a Difficulty determined by the GM.

### Crossbows
